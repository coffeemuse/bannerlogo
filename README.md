# bannerlogo for AgonLight
[![Build Status](https://github.com/coffeemuse/bannerlogo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coffeemuse/bannerlogo/actions)

This project is a C-based reimplementation inspired by the original [bootlogo](https://github.com/sijnstra/agon-projects/tree/main/bootlogo), written in z80 assembly by Shawn Sinjnstra. While not a direct port, it recreates core functionality using similar logic and structure. The original work is licensed under the MIT License, which this project continues to honor.

Initially this project was just a quick playground to test the new [agondev C/C++ Toolchain](https://github.com/AgonPlatform/agondev). Instead of a boring Hello World, I produced this as a learning project.
